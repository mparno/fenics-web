.. _about_components:

FEniCS is organized as a collection of interoperable components that
together form the FEniCS Project. A short overview of these components
is given below. Further information can be found in the :ref:`FEniCS
Book <book>` and on the `Bitbucket page
<https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project>`__.

.. _about_components_dolfin:

********************************************************
`DOLFIN <https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/dolfin>`__
********************************************************

DOLFIN is a C++/Python library that functions as the main user
interface of FEniCS. A large part of the functionality of FEniCS is
implemented as part of DOLFIN. It provides a problem solving
environment for models based on partial differential equations and
implements core parts of the functionality of FEniCS, including data
structures and algorithms for computational meshes and finite element
assembly. To provide a simple and consistent user interface, DOLFIN
wraps the functionality of other FEniCS components and external
software, and handles the communication between these components.

.. _about_components_ffc:

**************************************************
`FFC <https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/ffc>`__
**************************************************

One of the key features of FEniCS is automated code generation for the
general and efficient solution of finite element variational
problems. FFC (FEniCS Form Compiler) is a compiler for variational
forms. It generates efficient low-level C++ code (UFC) from a
high-level mathematical description (UFL) of a finite element
variational problem.

.. _about_components_fiat:

****************************************************
`FIAT <https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/fiat>`__
****************************************************

FIAT (FInite element Automatic Tabulator) supports generation of
arbitrary order instances of the Lagrange elements on lines,
triangles, and tetrahedra. It is also capable of generating arbitrary
order instances of Jacobi-type quadrature rules on the same element
shapes. Further, H(div) and H(curl) conforming finite element spaces
such as the families of Raviart-Thomas, Brezzi-Douglas-Marini and
Nedelec are supported on triangles and tetrahedra. Upcoming versions
will also support Hermite and nonconforming elements.

.. _about_components_instant:

**********************************************************
`Instant <https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/instant>`__
**********************************************************

Instant is a Python module that allows for instant inlining of C and
C++ code in Python. It is a small Python module built on top of SWIG
and Distutils. Instant is used by FFC and DOLFIN for just-in-time
(JIT) compilation of variational forms and expressions.

.. _about_components_ufc:

*************************************************************
`UFC <https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/ufc-deprecated>`__
*************************************************************

UFC (Unified Form-assembly Code) is a unified framework for finite
element assembly. More precisely, it defines a fixed interface for
communicating low level routines (functions) for evaluating and
assembling finite element variational forms. The UFC interface
consists of a single header file ufc.h that specifies a C++ interface
that must be implemented by code that complies with the UFC
specification.

.. _about_components_ufl:

**************************************************
`UFL <https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/ufl>`__
**************************************************

UFL (Unified Form Language) is a domain specific language for
declaration of finite element discretizations of variational
forms. More precisely, it defines a flexible interface for choosing
finite element spaces and defining expressions for weak forms in a
notation close to mathematical notation.

********************************************************
`Dorsal <https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/dorsal>`__
********************************************************

Dorsal is a shell script that simplifies the installation of FEniCS on
operating platforms that we do not support with prebuilt binaries. It
does this by automating the process of fetching, compiling, and
installing the various FEniCS sub-projects and their requisite
dependencies on many different platforms.
