About the FEniCS Project
########################

The FEniCS Project is a collaborative project for the development of
innovative concepts and tools for automated scientific computing, with
a particular focus on automated solution of differential equations by
finite element methods.

The methodology and software developed as part of the FEniCS Project
are documented in a number of :doc:`research articles
<../citing/index>` and a :doc:`book <../book/index>`. You can also
learn more about FEniCS from the following `presentations
<http://fenicsproject.org/pub/presentations/>`__.

********
Features
********

FEniCS has an :ref:`extensive list of features <features>` for
automated, efficient solution of differential equations, including
automated solution of variational problems, automated error control
and adaptivity, a comprehensive library of finite elements, high
performance linear algebra and many more.

**********
Components
**********

FEniCS is organized as a collection of interoperable
:ref:`components <about_components>` that
together form the FEniCS Project. These components include the
problem-solving environment :ref:`DOLFIN <about_components_dolfin>`,
the form compiler :ref:`FFC <about_components_ffc>`, the finite
element tabulator :ref:`FIAT <about_components_fiat>`, the
just-in-time compiler :ref:`Instant <about_components_instant>`, the
code generation interface :ref:`UFC <about_components_ufc>`, the form
language :ref:`UFL <about_components_ufl>` and a range of
:ref:`additional components <about_components_additional>`.

Building on these components, software specialized to solving
different problems are organised into separate :doc:`applications
<../applications/index>`.

Contributors
************

The FEniCS Project is developed by :ref:`researchers from a number of
research institutes <team>` from around the world. The following
research institutes (in alphabetical order) contribute
to the FEniCS Project:

* `Baylor University <http://www.baylor.edu>`__
* `Chalmers University of Technology <http://www.chalmers.se>`__
* `KTH Royal Institute of Technology <http://www.kth.se>`__
* `Simula Research Laboratory <http://www.simula.no>`__
* `University of Cambridge <http://www.cam.ac.uk>`__
* `University of Chicago <http://www.uchicago.edu/index.shtml>`__

Contributions have also been made by researchers from
`Delft University of Technology <http://www.tudelft.nl>`__,
`Argonne National Laboratory <http://www.anl.gov>`__
and many other research institutes.
A full list of contributors is maintained as part of the source code
of each FEniCS component.

The following video illustrates the development of the FEniCS Project
since its inception in 2003.
