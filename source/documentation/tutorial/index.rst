FEniCS tutorial (Python)
########################

*Written by Hans Petter Langtangen*

.. note::

    This tutorial is for FEniCS 1.0. For the most recent release of
    FEniCS, see the demo programs distributed with DOLFIN for the
    latest syntax.


This document presents a FEniCS tutorial to get new users quickly up
and running with solving differential equations. FEniCS can be
programmed both in C++ and Python, but this tutorial focuses
exclusively on Python programming, since this is the simplest approach
to exploring FEniCS for beginners and since it actually gives high
performance. After having digested the examples in this tutorial, the
reader should be able to learn more from the :ref:`FEniCS
documentation <documentation>` and from the FEniCS book
:ref:`Automated Solution of Differential Equations by the Finite
Element Method <book>`.

The reader is encouraged to contact the author at ``hpl@simula.no``
regarding typos, errors, and suggestions for improvements.

`A LaTeX/PDF version </_static/tutorial/fenics_tutorial_1.0.pdf>`_ is
also available, in addition to a `tarball with all programs referred
to </_static/tutorial/fenics_tutorial_examples.tar.gz>`_ in this
tutorial (pack out with the Unix command ``tar xvzf
fenics_tutorial_examples.tar.gz``).
