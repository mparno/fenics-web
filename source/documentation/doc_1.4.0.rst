####################################################
Documentation for FEniCS 1.4.0
####################################################

Our documentation includes a book, a collection of documented demo
programs, and complete references for the FEniCS application
programming interface (API). Note that the FEniCS API is documented
separately for each FEniCS component. The most important interfaces
are those of the C++/Python problem solving environment :ref:`DOLFIN
<about_components_dolfin>` and the form language :ref:`UFL
<about_components_ufl>`.

(*This page accesses the FEniCS 1.4.0 documentation. Not the
version you are looking for? See* :doc:`all versions <all>`.)

          <h2> The FEniCS Tutorial </h2>

A good starting point for new users is the :doc:`FEniCS Tutorial
<tutorial/index>`. The tutorial will help you get quickly up and
running with solving differential equations in FEniCS. The tutorial
focuses exclusively on the FEniCS Python interface, since this is the
simplest approach to exploring FEniCS for beginners.

    <h2>The FEniCS Book</h2>
    <a href="/book/"><img alt=''src='/_static/images/fenics_book_cover.png' class='avatar avatar-84 photo' width='84'/></a>

:ref:`The FEniCS Book <book>`, *Automated Solution of Differential
Equations by the Finite Element Method*, is a comprehensive (700
pages) book documenting the mathematical methodology behind the FEniCS
Project and the software developed as part of the FEniCS Project. The
FEniCS Tutorial is included as the opening chapter of the FEniCS Book.

  <h2>The FEniCS Manual</h2>

`The FEniCS Manual
<http://launchpad.net/fenics-book/trunk/final/+download/fenics-manual-2011-10-31.pdf>`__
is a 200-page excerpt from the FEniCS Book, including the FEniCS
Tutorial, an introduction to the finite element method and
documentation of DOLFIN and UFL.

  <h2>Additional Documentation</h2>

`Mixing software with FEniCS
<http://hplgit.github.io/fenics-mixed/doc/web/index.html>`__ is a
tutorial on how to combine FEniCS applications in Python with software
written in other languages.

    <h2>Demos</h2>

A simple way to build your first FEniCS application is to copy and
modify one of the existing demos:

* `Documented DOLFIN demos (Python) <../documentation/dolfin/1.4.0/python/demo/index.html>`__
* `Documented DOLFIN demos (C++) <../documentation/dolfin/1.4.0/cpp/demo/index.html>`__

The demos are :ref:`already installed on your system <finding_demos>` or can
be found in the ``demo`` directory of the DOLFIN source tree.

  <h2>Quick Programmer's References</h2>

Some of the classes and functions in DOLFIN are more frequently used
than others. To learn more about these, take a look at the

* `Basic classes and functions in DOLFIN (Python) <../documentation/dolfin/1.4.0/python/quick_reference.html>`__
* `Basic classes and functions in DOLFIN  (C++) <../documentation/dolfin/1.4.0/cpp/quick_reference.html>`__

  <h2>Complete Programmer's References</h2>

* `All classes and functions in DOLFIN (Python) <../documentation/dolfin/1.4.0/python/genindex.html>`__
* `All classes and functions in DOLFIN (C++) <../documentation/dolfin/1.4.0/cpp/genindex.html>`__
* `All classes and functions in UFL <../documentation/ufl/1.4.0/genindex.html>`__
