Release notes for FEniCS 1.0 (2011-12-07)
#########################################

We are pleased to announce the release of FEniCS 1.0. This is the
first stable and supported release of FEniCS.

FEniCS is an integrated problem solving environment for partial
differential equations for both Python and C++ users. A high-level
expressive interface is combined with efficiency through automated and
seamless generation of highly efficient low level code (C++). An
integrated domain-specific form language allows finite element
variational problems to be expressed in near-mathematical notation as
part of a simulation program.

Summary of features:

* An integrated domain-specific finite element form language
* Fully automated assembly of finite element variational forms
* Fully distributed simplex meshes in 1D, 2D, 3D
* High-performance linear algebra (based on PETSc and Trilinos)
* A large library of different finite elements
* Automated adaptive error control

FEniCS is available for a multitude of platforms, with prebuilt
binaries for Debian/Ubuntu, Mac OS X and Windows. In addition, an
automated build script automates the building of FEniCS and its
dependencies (including PETSc and Trilinos) on a large collection of
(*nix) platforms.

FEniCS is supported by extensive documentation, consisting of a
comprehensive tutorial, detailed API documentation and a range of
documented demos. In addition, the 700-page FEniCS book (Springer
2011) documents the methodology behind the FEniCS Project and
highlights a number of applications based on FEniCS.
