The new Centre for Computational Methods in Science and Engineering at
Imperial College London would like to announce two events related to
the FEniCS project.

* **FEniCS@Imperial day**
   June 18, 2012,
   Imperial College London

* **FEniCS training workshop**
   June 29 2012,
   Imperial College London

The first event is a half-day workshop on developments on and using the
FEniCS project. The objectives are to raise the profile of code
generation among the computational science community, and to build a
network among the users of FEniCS at Imperial and around the UK.

The headline speakers are:
 * Garth Wells (University of Cambridge)
 * Martin Sandve Alnæs (Simula Research Laboratory)
 * Patrick Farrell (Imperial College London)

The half-day workshop takes place on June 18 2012, from 1--5 pm.  For
details, see http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/computationalmethods/news#FEniCS.
Registration is due by *June 4 2012*.

The second event is a FEniCS training day on June 29 2012, given by
Marie Rognes. Dr. Rognes will give a hands-on tutorial suitable for
beginners.  The training course will be of interest to anyone who uses
or develops software for solving partial differential equations as a
part of their research. For details, see the URL above.

The training course takes place on the 29th of June, from 1--5 pm. To
register, please contact Patrick Farrell <patrick.farrell06@imperial.ac.uk>
by the *20th of June*.

Attendance at both events is free of charge.
