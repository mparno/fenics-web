The developers are always interested to see the problems that come up on the forum.
Please ask lots of questions, and please answer them, if you know the answer.

Remember when asking questions:

 - When posting code always post a simple, minimum working example.
 - Indent code by 4 spaces to get nice formatting.
 - Only ask questions about using FEniCS. Questions about installation should be on the support mailing list.
 - Everyone is giving their time for free to answer your questions!
