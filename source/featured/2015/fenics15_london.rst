We are pleased to announce the 2015 edition of the annual FEniCS
Workshop:

The workshop is an opportunity for all those interested the FEniCS
Project, and related projects such as dolfin-adjoint and Firedrake, to
exchange ideas, communicate their results and network with the
automated finite element community. The workshop welcomes existing and
potential developers and users of automated simulation systems, as
well as mathematicians interested in a high productivity computational
environment for finite element problems.
