Since FEniCS version 1.2, the FEniCS Project provides user-friendly
and efficient support for solving differential equations over domains
of differing topological and geometric dimension. For instance, you
can specify and solve an equation defined over the surface of a ball
(imagine the surface of the earth). This surface is a domain of
topological dimension 2, but embedded in three spatial dimensions and
thus of geometric dimension 3. In general, FEniCS supports simplicial
meshes of geometric dimension :math:`n = 1, 2, 3` and topological
dimension :math:`m \leq n`.

Partial differential equations posed over such meshes, so-called
immersed manifolds, are of particular importance in studying
geophysical flows; for instance, ocean and atmosphere simulations
crucially rely on the capability to solve equations over the
sphere. Similarly, a number of geological applications involve flow
equations defined over networks of fractures (intersecting
two-dimensional planes embedded in three dimensions). Physiological
simulation scenarios may involve networks of for instance blood
vessels (networks of lines or curves embedded in three dimensions).

How to use it

Given such a mesh, finite element spaces (including all our favorite
families of finite elements), measures and variational forms may be
defined as usual. For instance, here is a code snippet that solves an
elliptic equation over a mesh of a Gray's Klein bottle, a
non-orientable two-dimensional surface embedded in three dimensions.

.. code-block:: python

    from fenics import *

    # Import the mesh
    mesh = Mesh("klein.xml.gz")

    # Define the function space of choice as usual
    V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 2)
    u = TrialFunction(V)
    v = TestFunction(V)

    # Define the variational form as usual, but pay attention to the
    # definition of derivatives and measures
    f = Expression("x[0]*x[1]*x[2]", degree=3)
    c = Constant(0.03)
    a = c*u*v*dx + inner(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
    L = f*v*dx

    # Solve and plot as usual
    u = Function(V)
    solve(a == L, u)

    plot(mesh, title="Gray's Klein bottle")
    plot(u, title="u", interactive=True)

This runs seamlessly in serial or parallel using MPI, and the results
are plotted below:

surface without boundary embedded in 3D [2, 3]. Right: The solution to
the elliptic PDE example given above over this mesh.
