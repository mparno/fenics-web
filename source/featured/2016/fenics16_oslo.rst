the FEniCS Project and related projects to exchange ideas, communicate
their results and network with the automated scientific computing
community. We welcome developers, existing and potential users of the
FEniCS ecosystem as well as mathematicians, computer scientists and
application domain specialists interested in numerical methods, their
implementation and applications.

The FEniCS '16 workshop will emphasize an open and inclusive
atmosphere, contributed talks from a diverse range of scientific
areas, and dedicated time for discussions and coding.

Abstracts
*********

We very much welcome scientific contributions (talks and posters) to
the workshop.

We request that your abstract includes the title of the
presentation/poster and its authors and a short description of its
topic. We would encourage you to highlight the connection of your work
to the FEniCS community in your abstract and also to highlight new
features/results. We will notify you of abstract acceptance shortly
after the submission deadline.

* So, if you would like to contribute a talk, please think of a title
  and some keywords, and write a short abstract in
  [this LaTeX template](files/fenics16.tex) (think around 200 words),
  and submit this file via the EasyChair FEniCS'16 submission site:

  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fenics16

  Note that you need to create an EasyChair account if you do not
  have one already. Also you will need the
  [anslistings.sty](files/anslistings.sty) file to compile the
  template, but do not modify or submit this file.

* If you would like to contribute a poster (in addition to or instead
  of a talk), please just let Martin Alnæs (martinal@simula.no) know
  by April 4 2016. Please include 'FEniCS16 poster' in the subject of

Reaching the workshop
*********************

Simula Research Laboratory is located on the 3rd floor of
'Terminalbygget' at Technopolis at Fornebu, just outside of Oslo,
Norway, see `more directions
<https://www.simula.no/about/contact-simula>`__ on how to reach
Simula.

Fornebu can be reached by boat, train, bus or car from downtown
Oslo. The quickest and most comfortable way of reaching Simula is
probably by the 12-min express boat from downtown Oslo.

If you are flying in, we recommend that you fly in to Oslo Airport
Gardermoen (OSL). From there, the Airport Express train takes 22 min
to downtown Oslo (Oslo S or Nationaltheateret) and 30 min to Lysaker
(5-10 min by bus to/from Simula).

Accommodation
*************

Please book your own accommodation for the workshop. In view of the
Norwegian National Day on May 17 (see above), we politely urge you to
book your hotel early.

Visitors to the CBC often stay at one of these options:

* `Scandic Fornebu <http://www.scandichotels.com/Hotels/Norway/Oslo/Fornebu/>`__ (next door to Simula, but away from downtown)
* `Thon Hotel Slottsparken <http://www.thonhotels.no/hoteller/land/norge/oslo/thon-hotel-slottsparken/>`__ (Downtown)
* `Smarthotel Oslo <http://smarthotel.no/hotell/smarthotel-oslo>`__ (Downtown, budget option)
