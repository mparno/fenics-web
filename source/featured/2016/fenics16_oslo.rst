Abstracts
*********

We very much welcome scientific contributions (talks and posters) to
the workshop.

We request that your abstract includes the title of the
presentation/poster and its authors and a short description of its
topic. We would encourage you to highlight the connection of your work
to the FEniCS community in your abstract and also to highlight new
features/results. We will notify you of abstract acceptance shortly
after the submission deadline.

Contributing a talk
-------------------

So, if you would like to contribute a talk, please think of a title
and some keywords, and write a short abstract using :download:`this
LaTeX template <files/fenics16.tex>` (think around 200 words), then
compile with pdflatex and submit the pdf file via the EasyChair
FEniCS'16 submission site:

  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fenics16

Note that you need to create an EasyChair account if you do not have
one already. Also you will need the :download:`anslistings.sty
<files/anslistings.sty>` file to compile with the template if you use
source code listings.

This year, the CBC will award the **Best Student FEniCS'16
Presentation Prize** to the student author(s) of the most outstanding
presentation given at the FEniCS'16 workshop.

Contributing a poster
---------------------

If you would like to contribute a poster (in addition to or instead of
a talk), please just let Simon Funke (simon@simula.no) know by April
4 2016. Please include 'FEniCS16 poster' in the subject of your email.

If you have more time...
************************

May 17th is the `Norwegian Constitution Day
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Constitution_Day>`__, a
festive day filled with celebrations across the country. We would like
encourage all international workshop participants to arrive in Norway
a day or two early to the experience this event.

If you would like to stay longer for instance through weekend to visit
more of Norway, you may consider for instance the `Norway in a
Nutshell <http://www.norwaynutshell.com/>`__ Tours.

Reaching the workshop
*********************

Simula Research Laboratory is located on the 3rd floor of
'Terminalbygget' at Technopolis at Fornebu, just outside of Oslo,
Norway, see `more directions
<https://www.simula.no/about/contact-simula>`__ on how to reach
Simula.

Fornebu can be reached by boat, train, bus or car from downtown
Oslo. The quickest and most comfortable way of reaching Simula is
probably by the 12-min express boat from downtown Oslo.

If you are flying in, we recommend that you fly in to Oslo Airport
Gardermoen (OSL). From there, the Airport Express train takes 22 min
to downtown Oslo (Oslo S or Nationaltheateret) and 30 min to Lysaker
(5-10 min by bus to/from Simula).

Accommodation
*************

Please book your own accommodation for the workshop. In view of the
Norwegian National Day on May 17 (see above), we politely urge you to
book your hotel early.

Visitors to the CBC often stay at one of these options:

* `Scandic Fornebu <http://www.scandichotels.com/Hotels/Norway/Oslo/Fornebu/>`__ (next door to Simula, but away from downtown)
* `Thon Hotel Slottsparken <http://www.thonhotels.no/hoteller/land/norge/oslo/thon-hotel-slottsparken/>`__ (Downtown)
* `Smarthotel Oslo <http://smarthotel.no/hotell/smarthotel-oslo>`__ (Downtown, budget option)
