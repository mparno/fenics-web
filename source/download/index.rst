For information on user contributed binary packages, see
:ref:`contributed_packages`.


**********************************
Installation from *conda* packages
**********************************

Whether you are already using the Anaconda_ Python distribution from Continuum
Analytics or just their conda_ package manager in Linux you can already install
FEniCS precompiled binaries. They are not part of the official Anaconda
installation but they can be downloaded from a binstar_ channel::

    conda create --name fenics27 python=2.7
    source activate fenics27
    conda install fenics --channel juanlu001

For troubleshooting and alternative options for older systems, see
:ref:`installation_using_conda`.

**********************
Virtual machine images
**********************

A virtual machine image that includes the most recent FEniCS release
is available at
http://fenicsproject.org/pub/virtual/fenics-latest.ova. The image can
be run using a virtual machine manager, such as `VirtualBox
<https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_. The username and password for the
virtual machine are both ``fenics``.

The virtual machine image is recommended for systems for which a
binary installer is not available. The image is particularly suitable
when a consistent FEniCS environment across systems is required, such
as courses using FEniCS.

The image requires a 64-bit host operating system.


**********************************************
Installation from source (`fenics-install.sh`)
**********************************************

You may also choose to install FEniCS directly from source. This may be
done by running the following command::

    curl -s http://fenicsproject.org/fenics-install.sh | bash

Running this command will build a local installation of FEniCS, including
essential dependencies such as PETSc. The installation relies on
`HashDist <http://hashdist.github.io/>`__. Before running the script,
you may wish to download and inspect its contents.

Requirements:

* A standard Unix environment (Linux or OSX)
* The Git version control system, available as the package ``git`` in
  most Linux and Mac package managers
* OSX users will need to install Xcode from the Mac App Store


************************************
Nightly snapshots for Ubuntu and OSX
************************************

Every night, FEniCS snapshot releases are automatically generated for
Ubuntu and Mac OS X. They are made available at our :ref:`snapshots page
<snapshot_releases>`.


***************
Data and meshes
***************

A collection of meshes for free use with FEniCS is available
:ref:`here <data>`.
