The FEniCS Book
###############

***************************************************************************
*Automated Solution of Differential Equations by the Finite Element Method*
***************************************************************************

This book is written by researchers and developers behind the FEniCS
Project and explores an advanced, expressive approach to the development
of mathematical software. The presentation spans mathematical background,
software design and the use of FEniCS in applications. Theoretical aspects
are complemented with computer code which is available as free/open source
software. The book begins with a tutorial for readers who are new to the
topic. Following the tutorial, chapters in Part I address fundamental
aspects of the approach to automating the creation of finite element
solvers. Chapters in Part II address the design and implementation of the
FEnicS software. Chapters in Part III present the application of FEniCS
to a wide range of applications, including fluid flow, solid mechanics,
electromagnetics and geophysics.
