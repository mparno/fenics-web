Asking questions
================

If you need help with anything related to FEniCS, ranging from
installation issues to how to best solve a PDE, ask your question
in the `FEniCS Q&A forum <http://fenicsproject.org/qa/>`__.

If you have a specific question related to obtaining, building, or
installing a FEniCS component, please send a message to the `FEniCS
support mailing list
<http://fenicsproject.org/mailman/listinfo/fenics-support>`_.

Before running away and posting your question, please take a minute
to consider the follow points:

* Search the forum to check that your question has not been answered before.

* Search the `FEniCS user questions on Launchpad <http://answers.launchpad.net/fenics-project/>`__ to check that your question has not been answered before.

* Formulate your question well. If we cannot understand your question,
  we probably cannot help you.

* Post complete, but *minimal* code examples. No one wants to read
  through your complex application code.

* Please help out in answering questions from other users.

* Tag your question appropriately.

Reporting bugs
==============

If you encounter something you suspect is a bug, please file a bug report
using the Bitbucket issue tracking system. In particular, for
reporting bugs in DOLFIN, visit the `DOLFIN issues page
<https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/dolfin/issues>`_. As above, post
complete but *minimal* code examples.

Mailing lists
=============

.. _help_mailinglist:

The main `FEniCS mailing list
<http://fenicsproject.org/mailman/listinfo/fenics>`__ is where
discussions take place. It covers everything that does not fit into
any of the above categories (user questions, bug reports or
installation or compilation issues). This is also the place for
announcements of workshops, releases, tutorials, papers. Everyone is
invited to subscribe to the mailing list and take part in discussions.

The `FEniCS support mailing list
<http://fenicsproject.org/mailman/listinfo/fenics-support>`_ is a
place to ask specific questions related to obtaining, building, or
installing FEniCS components.

Contributing
============

We encourage users to take active part in developing and documenting
FEniCS. As an active developer, it is easy to influence the direction
and focus of the project. The step from user to developer is just a
patch away! For information about how to contribute code to the FEniCS
Project, visit the page :ref:`developers`.
