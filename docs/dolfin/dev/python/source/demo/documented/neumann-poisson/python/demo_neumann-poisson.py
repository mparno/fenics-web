This demo program illustrates how to solve Poisson's equation

    - div grad u(x, y) = f(x, y)

on the unit square with pure Neumann boundary conditions:

    du/dn(x, y) = -sin(5*x)

and source f given by

    f(x, y) = 10*exp(-((x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2) / 0.02)

Since only Neumann conditions are applied, u is only determined up to
a constant c by the above equations. An addition constraint is thus
required, for instance

  \int u = 0

This can be accomplished by introducing the constant c as an
additional unknown (to be sought in the space of real numbers)
and the above constraint.
