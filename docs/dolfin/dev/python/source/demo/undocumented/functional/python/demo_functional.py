"""This demo program computes the value of the functional

    M(v) = int v^2 + (grad v)^2 dx

on the unit square for v = sin(x) + cos(y). The exact
value of the functional is M(v) = 2 + 2*sin(1)*(1 - cos(1))

The functional M corresponds to the energy norm for a
simple reaction-diffusion equation."""
