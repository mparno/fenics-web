"""This demo program solves the mixed formulation of Poisson's
equation:

    sigma - grad(u) = 0
       - div(sigma) = f

The corresponding weak (variational problem)

    <sigma, tau> + <div(tau), u>   = 0       for all tau
                 - <div(sigma), v> = <f, v>  for all v

is solved using BDM (Brezzi-Douglas-Marini) elements of degree k for
(sigma, tau) and DG (discontinuous Galerkin) elements of degree k - 1
for (u, v).
