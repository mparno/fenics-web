This demo illustrates how to:

* Define CSG geometries
* Generate meshes from geometries

The domain looks as follows:

.. image:: ../csg_boundary.png
	:scale: 75 %

and the mesh:

.. image:: ../csg_mesh.png
	:scale: 75 %

Problem definition
------------------------

We do not have any equation in this demo. The demo focuses purely on the geometry and how to generate a mesh from it.
