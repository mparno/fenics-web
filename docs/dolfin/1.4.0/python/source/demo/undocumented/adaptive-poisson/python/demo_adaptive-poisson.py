"""This demo program solves Poisson's equation

    - div grad u(x, y) = f(x, y)

on the unit square with source f given by

    f(x, y) = exp(-100(x^2 + y^2))

and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Note that we use a simplified error indicator, ignoring
edge (jump) terms and the size of the interpolation constant.
