"""This demo demonstrates how to compute functionals (or forms in
general) over subsets of the mesh. The two functionals lift and
drag are computed for the pressure field around a dolphin. Here, we
use the pressure field obtained from solving the Stokes equations
(see demo program in the sub directory
src/demo/pde/stokes/taylor-hood).

The calculation only includes the pressure contribution (not shear
forces).
