"""This demo program solves Poisson's equation

    - div grad u(x, y) = f(x, y)

on the unit square with source f given by

    f(x, y) =    -1.0 if (x - 0.33)^2 + (y - 0.67)^2 < 0.015
                  5.0 if 0.015 < (x - 0.33)^2 + (y - 0.67)^2 < 0.025
                 -1.0 if (x,y) in triangle( (0.55, 0.05), (0.95, 0.45), (0.55, 0.45) )
                  0.0 otherwise

and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.
