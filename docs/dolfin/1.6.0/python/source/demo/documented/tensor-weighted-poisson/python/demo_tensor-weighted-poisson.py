"""This demo program solves Poisson's equation

    - div C grad u(x, y) = f(x, y)

on the unit square with source f given by

    f(x, y) = 10*exp(-((x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2) / 0.02)

and boundary conditions given by

    u(x, y) = 0  for x = 0 or x = 1
du/dn(x, y) = 0  for y = 0 or y = 1

The conductivity C is a symmetric 2 x 2 matrix which
varies throughout the domain. In the left part of the
domain, the conductivity is

    C = ((1, 0.3), (0.3, 2))

and in the right part it is

    C = ((3, 0.5), (0.5, 4))

The data files where these values are stored are generated
by the program generate_data.py

This demo is dedicated to BF and Marius... ;-)
