"""
This program demonstrates interpolation onto a mesh which is not
completely covered by the original mesh. This situation may arise
during mesh refinement as a result of round-off errors.

When interpolating, DOLFIN tries to locate each point in the original
mesh. If that fails, the closest cell is found and the values
extrapolated from there.
