# The bilinear form a(u, v) and linear form L(v) for a multimesh
# formulation of Poisson's equation.
#
# Compile this form with FFC: ffc -l dolfin MultiMeshPoisson.ufl.

# Define element
element = FiniteElement("Lagrange", triangle, 1)

# Define trial and test functions and right-hand side
u = TrialFunction(element)
v = TestFunction(element)
f = Coefficient(element)

# Define facet normal and mesh size
n = FacetNormal(triangle)
h = 2.0*Circumradius(triangle)
h = (h('+') + h('-')) / 2

# Define custom measures (FIXME: prettify this)
dc0 = dc(0, metadata={"num_cells": 1})
dc1 = dc(1, metadata={"num_cells": 2})
dc2 = dc(2, metadata={"num_cells": 2})

# Define measures for integration
dx = dx + dc0 # domain integral
di = dc1      # interface integral
do = dc2      # overlap integral

# Parameters
alpha = 4.0
beta = 4.0

# Bilinear form
a = dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx \
  - dot(avg(grad(u)), jump(v, n))*di \
  - dot(avg(grad(v)), jump(u, n))*di \
  + alpha/h*jump(u)*jump(v)*di \
  + dot(jump(grad(u)), jump(grad(v)))*do

# Linear form
L = f*v*dx
